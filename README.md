# .mydot
My dot file in my home directory.
I spent so long on the config files of my applications that I find useful to backup them online
and share with the ones that have similar applications.

Some of the applications I use:
Mutt, Vim, Ranger, Tmux, Zsh.
There are also configurations of some windows manager I use like i3 or openbox.
